# Horiseon Code Refactor

[Link to Deployed Application](https://505laura.github.io/module-1-challenge)

## Description

This code is designed to adhere to accessibility standards through optimizing it for search engines. This is done through using semantic markup in a logical structure, adding descriptions of images to assist with disabilities and making the code overall more readable.

## Visuals

## Usage

Through using the navigation bar at the top of the page, you will be able to find different parts of the webpage more easily. If the images are not displaying, there will be text in their place describing what they would have shown. If you have a disability that impairs your ability to read the webpage, you will be able to understand what it contains and in what order through tools like a screen reader.
